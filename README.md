### TODO
* Complete combat cycle:
** characters can equip a weapon (might have to invent backpack first)
** create instance-of-npc class for use with battle models, (BaseMobile>NonPlayerChar>?instance?of?npc?)
** Add real enemies, link to rando spawn locations
** during battle create draw from enemies linked to curr loc
* Funk, autoact
* pacifist system, value in battle model, code in battlestack
* kill type count belongs to account, store in plater.models.Config
* Decide how to handle non-user owned containers (guild|bank|faction)
* Add install wizard or inject initial data check/add in url('index')
* pick a better name for playing_toon
* The (user|character)_is blocks are not DRY
