### TODO
* Complete combat cycle:
* characters can equip a weapon (might have to invent backpack first)
* create instance-of-npc class for use with battle models, (BaseMobile>NonPlayerChar>?instance?of?npc?)
* Add real enemies, link to rando spawn locations
* during battle create, draw from enemies linked to curr loc
* pacifist system, value in battle model, code in battlestack
* kill type count belongs to account, store it in player.models.Config
* pick a better name for playing_toon
* The (user|character)_is blocks are not DRY
* If container.category is not neeeded by 0.0.10a delete it.
